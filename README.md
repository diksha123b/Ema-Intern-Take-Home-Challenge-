## Overview
The QA system ingests data from GitHub repositories and web pages, processes it into a structured format, and enables query-based responses using embeddings and a language model.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. ### Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/diksha123b/Ema-Intern-Take-Home-Challenge-.git

cd qa-system

2. ### Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Install the required packages:

[pip install -r requirements.txt](#fhew)

## Usage
